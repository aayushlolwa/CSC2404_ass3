This project is to develop a Java application. 
The application compares the area of a number 
of different shapes such as Circles, Squares and 
Rectangles. 

 The implementation of the application consists of
    1) Shapes.java -- It is the base class of any shapes
    2) TestShape.java -- This is the main projram, which 
       is used to sort them in order of area sizes for a 
       given number of Shapes and their attrbutes.
    3) Circle.java -- A derived class, which is to input 
       the the radius.
    4) Square.java -- A derived class, which is to input 
       the side length of the square.
    5) Rectangle.java -- A derived class, which input the
       the length of longside and the shortside.
